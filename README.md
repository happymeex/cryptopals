# Matasano Cryptopals Challenge

The [Cryptopals Challenge](https://cryptopals.com/) is a set of programming
exercises teaching hands-on cryptography.

As of now, I've implemented the first set. This is mainly to practice developing
in C++ and to learn some crypto.

## Testing

I'm using Catch2 for unit tests.
Run `make [file]` and then `./build/[file]` to run the tests in a given file.
